## SpDISTAL: Compiling Distributed Sparse Tensor Computations

https://rohany.github.io/blog/warp-specialization/

The paper introduces SpDISTAL, a compiler for distributed sparse tensor algebra that combines separate descriptions of computation, sparse data structures, and data/computation distribution to generate high-performance code competitive with hand-written libraries.

- Idea would to be to extend this to pure SSMs.
